    "Purpose:\n",
    "- This code scrapes only a few cars to test functionality.\n",
    "- It ensures that the scraping logic works before scaling to the full dataset.\n",
    "- It helps identify potential issues (e.g., page structure changes, missing elements) before running a full scrape.\n",

    "Once validated, this script can be expanded into a full version that scrapes all available listings.\n",
